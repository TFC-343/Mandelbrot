# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot code

This code obviously needs python but other than this I haven’t used any libraries

Thanks to all those on reddit for who were interested in my code, so here it is.

Sorry; this isn’t my best work.
	I never expected that people would want to see it.

I have *tried* to comment on all the code to make it better but I can't promise anything

In testing it took about 2500 second to render because of how horrifically unoptimised my code is, so run the ‘main.py’ code and go make a cup of tea.

I *think* that i found the issue but haven't tried to fix it (more on line 36 in 'complex_maths.py')

Ps. please don’t steal my code
