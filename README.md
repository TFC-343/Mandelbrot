# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot code

This code needs needs python and numpy

Thanks to all those on reddit for who were interested in my code, so here it is.

In testing it took about 30-60 seconds to render but the Tk can crash if there are too many pixels in the canvas,
	on line 13 in main.py there is a var called 'pixels' chaging this will change how many different pixels there are on the screen.
